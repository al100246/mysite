  <p style="color:6d6875;"> Welcome to the most ultimate crochet website, designed for the most beginners to most advanced crocheters!</p>
  <img src = "https://bhookedcrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/How-to-Crochet-Step-by-Step-for-Beginners.jpg"/>
  <p style="color:6d6875;"> As you will see, this website has been divided up into multiple sections. The sections are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Index
  <li> Crochet for Beginners
    <li> Amigurumi Patterns
      <li> Bag Patterns
        <li> Clothing Items Patterns
       <li> Miscellaneous Patterns
       </ul> </p>
   <p style="color:6d6875;">This page right here is the index. Here we will be going through the supplies you will need to crochet. <br>
  Obviously, if you have a local yarn store near you, such as in USA you may find Joanns, or in Bahrain you may find Mony Crochet, you can buy it from there, but there is really no need to buy it from a physical store. <br>
    You could also buy it online, for example from Amazon or Temu. There are many different types of yarn, however the one I would recommend for these patterns would be 3 ply milk cotton yarn, but any yarn would do, making sure you alter the stitch count accordingly. <br>
  As for the hooks, I would recommend a metal hook with a handle. Hooks with handles are useful as they reduce hand pain while crocheting, while also ensuring a firmer and more confortable grip. <br>
  Metal grips are more sturdy, whereas plastic hooks are low quality and will fall apart more easily. <br>
  Some other materials you will need are: <br>
    Darning Needles (to weave in your yarn tails which are sticking out - darning needles are also known as tapestry needles or yarn needles) <br>
  Stitch Markers (for marking stitches - these are really useful - hoever some other things you could use instead are safety pins or bobby pins) <br>
  Scissors (Any good quality scissors will work) <br>
  Safety Eyes (safety eyes are for amigurumi, basically for adding eyes to you cute little creation!) <br>
  Stuffing (Again, stuffing is for amigurumi, and you could also use cotton or yarn scraps)</p>
